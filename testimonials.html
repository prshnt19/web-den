						<p class="testimonial">Dr.Yogita Sagar healed our fear from dentist .She is doing the work so fast,gentle and skillful. When many teeth have to be done , it's best you stay close by, because whenever Yogita has the time, she calls for an additional appointment to finish all in time.
                        It feels more like going to visit family and friends, staff is very helpful and nice 
                        For everyone who had previous bad/difficult experiences with dentist,we really recomend Yogita.She is wonderful. 
                        Thank you very much Yogita.</p>

						<p class="testimonial">I was referred to Dr.Sagar by a good friend from Shivanand Ashram. I am from NYC in the U.S and was needing 7 dental implants. I came in to the office to see Dr Sagar immediately upon hearing the rave reviews from my yoga friend.<br>
                        I was thoroughly pleased impressed with her office, the professionalism, cleanliness,staff and personal touch. I felt extremely welcome there and well taken care of. All my questions were answered and a complete consultation ensued. She set a treatment plan for the 7 implants . I had only 3 weeks left in Delhi, so we decided to perform all 7 in 1 go. I already had 1 implant from 20 years ago, which had not been 
                        an easy procedure.Dr Sagar's treatment of 7 implants was less painful easier and quicker to heal than the 1 from the past. I was thrilled, amazed and most pleased. Dr Sagar made sure to match the colour of the crowns to me original teeth and took her time to place then and sculpt them to perfection. They not only look beautiful they feel like a million bucks. My confidence level has risen. I can smile a full true joyful smile without the self conscious feeling that one may notice my partial denture that I have fake teeth. Now I laugh, sing,eat and enjoy life fully again. Teeth are very important to me and having the confidence to speak and smile in front of a group of students is necessary. I am also a kirtan singer and truly appreciate that now I can sing my heart out of creator with grace and confidence.<br> 
                        Thank you so very much Dr Yogita Sagar for providing such beautiful,caring, professional and exceptional service. you have honed your craft care to perfection. You intuition and kindness touch my soul I thank you 100 million times and more. I can't express enough my happiness with the crafts manship   excellence and service received here I recommend Dr Sagar with five stars. 
                        <br>Thank you so very much.</p>
